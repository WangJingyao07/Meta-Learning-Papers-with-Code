![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-Welcome-green) 
![Stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/WangJingyao07/Meta-Learning-Papers-with-Code)

This repository contains a reading list of papers with code on **Meta-Learning** and **Meta-Reinforcement-Learning**, These papers are mainly categorized according to the type of model. In addition, I will separately list papers from important conferences starting from 2023, e.g., NIPS, ICML, ICLR, CVPR etc. **This repository is still being continuously improved. If you have found any relevant papers that need to be included in this repository, please feel free to submit a pull request (PR) or open an issue.**

Each paper may be applicable to one or more types of meta-learning frameworks, including optimization-based and metric-based, and may be applicable to multiple data sources, including image, text, audio, video, and multi-modality. **These are marked in the type column**. In addition, for different tasks and different problems, **we have marked the SOTA algorithm separately**. This is submitted with reference to the leadboard at the time of submission, and will be continuously modified. **We provide a basic introduction to each paper to help you understand the work and core ideas of this article more quickly**.

### Label

🎭 **Different Frameworks**

* ![Meta-Learning](https://img.shields.io/badge/-ML-gray) Meta-Learning.
* ![Meta-Reinforcement-Learning](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MRL-white)  Meta-Reinforcement-Learning.

🎨 **Different Types**

* ![optimization-based](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Optimization-blue) Optimization-based meta-learning approaches acquire a collection of optimal initial parameters, facilitating rapid convergence of a model when adapting to novel tasks.
* ![metric-based](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Metric-red)  Metric-based meta-learning approaches acquire embedding functions that transform instances from various tasks, allowing them to be readily categorized using non-parametric methods.

✨ **Different Data Sources**

* ![Image](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CVimage-brightgreen) Meta-Learning for CV (Images)
* ![Video](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CVvideo-green) Meta-Learning for CV (Videos)
* ![Text](https://img.shields.io/badge/-NLP-pink)  Meta-Learning for NLP
* ![Audio](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Audio-orange)  Meta-Learning for Audio
* ![Multi](https://img.shields.io/badge/-MultiModal-purple)  Meta-Learning for Multi-modal

It is worth noting that the experiments of some frameworks consist of multiple data sources. Our annotations are based on the paper description.

🎁 **Notice**

* ![❗CODE](https://img.shields.io/badge/-❗CODE-yellow) The paper does not provide code, I will write it myself and supplement it later.

🚩 **I have marked some recommended papers with 🌟/🎈 (SOTA methods/Just my personal preference 😉).**
